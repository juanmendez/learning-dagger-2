# Learning Dagger 2

I started migrating to Dagger 2 from Dagger 1. Initially I thought it was just getting myself familiar with some updates but I started to struggle, so I thought it would be easier if I start from scratch making demos and learning one step at a time.

I am making branches for different subjects and currently I am playing with tree components. I made this repository available so if there are others who get a bit lost like I did can play with any of these branches.

This project is Android free, so run it with IntelliJ or another editor of your choice.

If running on IntelliJ, in order to update do Gradle>clean, and Gradle>build, that way Dagger library regenerates classes in order to build your components.
