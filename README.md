# Multibindings

These demos come are a copy from [Dagger 2's documentation](https://google.github.io/dagger/multibindings.html)

You can gather a collection of objects from different modules and make your collection as a dependency used for other dependencies.
Also this new collection is availble directly at the generated component.
